    Fix a server bug inserting big varchar/varbinary data using BCP

    Recent MSSQL product seems to not handle correctly VARCHAR(MAX),
    NVARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX) sent using bulk operation if
    the data contains the full length.
    This is not coherent with documentation and the way data is sent
    using parameter the way server reply these fields (which should
    have the same format).
    Using unspecified length (as native client application seems to
    do) fix the issue.

    defncopy: Increase sql_text size to make sure is enough for new servers

    On MSSQL 2016 onward syscolumns.text field is 8000 characters long.
    The sql_text variable that should hold the conversion is 16000 bytes
    which are not enough to convert any converted string.
    Increase a bit to make sure is big enough.
    This is a temporary fix, should be allocated dynamically to make
    sure will continue to work.

    Always use max size for TEXT/NTEXT/IMAGE

    The network type information for these types allows to specify a
    size. However the definition of the type does not came with a size.
    Former implementation does not allows this type to be output and
    seems to ignore that length and accept any data even if bigger
    (data has also another length field).
    Current implementations allows to have BLOBs as output but not
    using these types.
    All tests passes with these sizes specified so feels safe and at
    the same time does not violate the assertion on other types where
    the data size has to be maximum the column size.

    Added support for configurable openssl cipher list

    Added new option to freetds.conf for specifying the cipher list
    supplied to openssl. This is necessary for several reasons:
    1. organizations that need more control over the specifics of
      encrypted connections
    2. to overcome the occasional incompatibility (sometimes intermittent)
       between open source encryption libraries and Microsoft's
       implementations. For example, several users reported intermittent
       connection problems where roughly 0.5% of connection attempts would
       fail for some reason. Removing specific key exchange protocols
       provided relief in at least one case.
    3. The cipher list can be specified in more generic terms, e.g.
       "HIGH:!SSLv2:!aNULL:-DH" rather than having to list specific cipher
       configurations that are otherwise subject to becoming outdated as
       the encryption landscape changes.

    do not compile as bundle under Mac OS X is --with-odbc-nodm is specified

    In this case the driver will be used as a dynamic library (not loaded

    In case a DM is used unit tests/application will link to the DM which
    will load the driver (requiring to be a module on old Mac OS X versions).
